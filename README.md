GestureMate is a project that leverages the powerof computer vision. It is a touchless interactive system that allows users to control screen brightness and volume using hand gestures captured by a webcam.
# GestureMate: Hand Gesture based Brightness and Volume Control

Programming Language: **Python**

Libraries: 
- OpenCV – handles video captures and frame processing
- MediaPipe – Utilized for accurate hand landmark detection, tracking and recognition.
- NumPy – for numerical operations, including interpolating the volume and brightness level.
- Flask – to link the front-end and back-end, serving real-time
- video feeds and processing gestures.
- Pycaw: to control audio volume via gesture input.
- Python (Backend processing)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend interface)

**Note: Left hand is for controlling brightness of the system and Right hand is for controlling the volume of the system.**
